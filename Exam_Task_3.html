        <b><abbr title="Black_hole">B.H</abbr></b>
        <p>A <u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u> is a region of spacetime where <ins>gravity</ins> is so strong that nothing, including light or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation">electromagnetic waves</a>, has enough energy to escape it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a <u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u>. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. <br> 
            Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a <u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u> acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory_in_curved_spacetime">quantum field theory in curved spacetime</a> predicts that event horizons emit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">Hawking radiation</a>, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar <u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u>s, making it essentially impossible to observe directly. <br>
            Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by <mark>John Michell</mark> and <mark>Pierre-Simon Laplace</mark> In 1916, <mark>Karl Schwarzschild</mark> found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a <u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u>. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "<u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u>" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. <br> 
            <u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u>s were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by <mark>Jocelyn Bell Burnell</mark> in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first <u><strong><u>Black hole</u></strong></u> known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.
